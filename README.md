# csdconfigs
Repository for configurations and editions/fixes for CSD python API

Found problems/solutions:

- After the new update R is broken in the API. I downloaded R and fixed it manually. I downloaded the API from the conda official conda package. 
- A tip for getting the MHBP to work is to see the result in the .Rout file.
